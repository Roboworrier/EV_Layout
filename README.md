# EV_Layout
•Used Simulink to create live Electrical Vehicle working Layout and System connections.
• Matlab provides us with a strong tool named smilulink which helps us to develop any mechanical or electrical utility layout or Power input output simulation.
• In this Project, I've used Simulink to simulate the Working layout of a Electric Vehicle.
• Working layout includes The battery Connection, Power Input and Out Regulatory System.
• On Mechanical Side it includes Gear box system, Tire controlling System and Handling.
• Simulink also comes with lot's of tools and modules and Power train is one of them it's pretty handy and useful Specially Vehicle Designing System.
